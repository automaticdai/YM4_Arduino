# YM4_Arduino
This project holds the Arduino library of the YM4 Mobile Robot platform. 

## What is YM4?
The YM4 is a mobile robot platform designed for robot amateurs and now is at its 4th generation. The YM4 is a cube with a size of 7.5cm * 7.5cm * 7.5 cm, which is the standard of the FIRA robot football competition. The robot uses a Arduino-compatiable microcontroller, the AVR(R) ATMega 328, and it can be programmed with the Arduino IDE.

## How to install the library?
Download all the project files and extract the folder into $(Arduino_dir)\libraries, where Arduino_dir is the directory where your Arduino is installed.

## How to use the library?
The examples of the usage are included in the library. Once installed the library, you can find them in the Arduino IDE from File->Examples->YM4_Arduino.
